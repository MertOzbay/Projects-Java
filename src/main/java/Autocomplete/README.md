Autocomplete
============

This package serves as a basis for an autocomplete application. A word prefix is used to generate a list of possible candidate words, from which a word can be chosen to update the candidate list for next time. Alternatively, if the desired word is not in the candidate list, it can also be used to update the candidate list.
