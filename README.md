# Projects-Java

I use the repository to share projects in Java that I made for class or in my own free time. Currently, the projects include:

1. [Autocomplete](https://github.com/MertOzbay/Projects-Java/tree/master/src/main/java/Autocomplete#readme) 
2. [EveryMST](https://github.com/MertOzbay/Projects-Java/tree/master/src/main/java/EveryMST#readme): Generating every Minimum Spanning Tree of a given graph
